# Learn Programming

This project is designed to help people learn the basics of computer programming, whether it's to see if it is a career that would interest them, or to just learn about how to fully utilize the powerful tool that is the computer and understand how it is used in our world today.

## What is a computer, and what can it be used for?

It's a powerful tool that can execute mathematical instructions. A set of such instructions is called an "algorithm."

Computers can be used for communication, playing games, doing work, school, or research, etc

## So, what is programming?

Programming is the creation of new algorithms.

### Examples of algorithms

- Finding the average age of a group of people
- Verify if someone is old enough to get their driver's license
- Recommend a video for you to watch
- Find results for an online search and sort the results by relevance

Finding the average age of a group of people:
1. Get each person's age
2. Add the ages together to get a total
3. Divide the total by how many people

This is a simple algorithm with only 3 steps, but algorithms can be complexe with many steps. Some steps can even be their own algorithm, such as getting the total age (steps 1 and 2).

> Try It Yourself: Manually follow this algorithm to get the average age of the people in your group or at home in your family.
