# Memory - What is RAM?

Space used by the program to remember things to be used later.

In our example, we can use RAM to keep track of the "total" age between calculations.

## What kinds of things can be stored in RAM?

Pretty much anything. Numbers, text, images, videos, 3D objects, music, etc

# HISTORY: How much RAM?

In the 1980s, many home computers had as little as 4 kilobytes of RAM. The Nintendo Entertainment System only had 2kb built in! 4kb can only store about 4096 characters of text. Nowadays, smart phones have at least several gigabytes of RAM. 1gb can store over 1 billion characters of text.
